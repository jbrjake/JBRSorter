## About
This is an attempt at answering a standard computer science question without looking at any resources:
* No googling
* No reference books
* No nothing.
* (Just vague, distant memories of the algorithms books I read years and years ago.)

*As a result, it's really bad code. There are lots of mistakes along the way, and no one should ever consider using this code for anything.
The techniques used are very naive.*

## Language
I'm sketching this out in Ruby for now. Once I've worked past my inefficient initial ideas for how to everything, I intend to port it to Objective-C.

## Next steps
See the TODO.txt for what I plan to do next.

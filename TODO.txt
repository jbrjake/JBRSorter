TODO

- Try out some things to speed up search of the nodes.
    - What if I added some concept of ancestry to the nodes?
    - I could jump directly to a node's left's left or right's right and skip some tests
        - For example, I'm checking the left and right payloads twice per search
    - I bet I could have this run on two threads, with one thread each for left and right searches.
- Port to Obj-C
    - Instruments, how I miss thee....
- It would be nice to test with a real large data set
- Fix the problem with the rands being floats
